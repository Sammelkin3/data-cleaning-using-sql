# data-cleaning-using-sql

Features:

Data Quality Improvement:

Identifies and removes duplicate records based on various criteria to ensure data integrity.
Standardizes data formatting (e.g., capitalization, date formats) for consistency across the dataset.
Handles missing values using appropriate techniques like imputation or deletion based on data distribution.
Optionally includes functionality for outlier detection and correction (if applicable to your project).
Modular and Organized Code:
Employs functions and procedures to enhance code readability and maintainability.
Uses clear and descriptive variable names for better understanding.
Includes comments to explain specific data cleaning steps (optional).
Flexibility:
Can be easily adapted to clean different datasets by adjusting specific queries and conditions.
Optionally allows customization of cleaning parameters (e.g., imputation methods) through configuration files (if applicable).


Approach:

Data Exploration and Understanding:
Analyze the data structure (tables, columns, data types) using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Identify potential data quality issues through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Data Cleaning Techniques:
Develop SQL queries to address specific data quality problems encountered during exploration.
Leverage various functionalities:
JOIN clauses for duplicate detection and merging.
String manipulation functions (TRIM, REPLACE) for formatting standardization.
Conditional statements (CASE WHEN) and aggregation functions (e.g., AVG, MEDIAN) for missing value imputation (if applicable).
Optionally utilize window functions (e.g., RANK, PERCENTILE) for outlier handling (if applicable).
Data Quality Validation:
Verify the effectiveness of data cleaning by re-running data quality checks and comparing results before and after cleaning.
Ensure the cleaned data is consistent, complete, and suitable for further analysis.


Benefits:

Improves data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.
Increases the efficiency and accuracy of data-driven decision-making.
Provides a reusable framework for data cleaning similar datasets.
This project utilizes SQL to:

Leverage powerful data manipulation capabilities.
Perform complex cleaning tasks efficiently.
Integrate seamlessly with existing data infrastructure.
